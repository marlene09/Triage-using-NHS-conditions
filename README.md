# NHS Triage Assistant ‚Äî Open Source Proof of Concept

This is a **multimodal prototype** that demonstrates how an NHS-style triage chatbot could combine
‚úÖ **text understanding** (NHS.uk guidance) and  
üñºÔ∏è **image understanding** (skin rash photos).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For demonstration only ‚Äî not medical advice.


## Problem solving
?. combining/weigthing text and image input --> describe physical characteristics and create summary with provisional diagnosis--> clinician approves or disapproves ---> message back to patient. During wait, the chat bot provides guidelines such as if conditions worsens contact 999, or in the meantime symptomatic relief such as .... 

## Workflow

***Pediatric Rash Triage POC Workflow***

**User Input**

Upload a photo of the rash.

Optionally, enter textual info: age, symptoms, duration, location.

**Multi-Modal Analysis (Image + Text)**

Image ‚Üí Medical rash classifier identifies patterns (HFMD, chickenpox, allergic rash, etc.).

Text ‚Üí NLP module extracts context (fever, itching, recent exposures).

Combined ‚Üí Weighted reasoning: LLM fuses image + text to describe physical characteristics and propose a provisional diagnosis.

Example output: ‚ÄúChild has red vesicular spots around hands, feet, and mouth, consistent with early-stage HFMD.‚Äù

**Provisional Guidance Generation**

LLM produces a patient-friendly summary:

Provisional diagnosis

Typical course

Symptomatic relief (hydration, paracetamol, calamine lotion)

Red flags (‚ÄúContact 999 if‚Ä¶‚Äù)

*This is not sent to the patient yet*

**Human-in-the-Loop Review**

Clinician receives image + text summary + provisional diagnosis.

Approves, edits, or disapproves.

**Patient Communication**

If approved, the final message is sent to the patient.

Includes:

Diagnosis summary

Symptomatic care instructions

Urgent action guidance if condition worsens
